## What it is?
**brewchecker** is a tool for checking [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) packages' availability, written in Python.

## What it does?
It downloads latest [Homebrew sources](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew) to temporary folder, scans [`Formula`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula) folder for formulas, parse every of them, and tries to download every package, patch, etc from 'stable' section.

**Output of this script is JSON document with statuses of all Formulas' resources.**

## Installation
### Requirements
#### System-wide applications
You must have `libcurl` library installed, and follow VCS binaries in `PATH`:

* `git`
* `hg`
